# Welcome to Pywedge documentation

## What is Pywedge?
Pywedge is a [pip installable](https://pypi.org/project/pywedge/) Python package that intends to,

1. Make multiple interactive charts in a single line of code, to enable the user to quickly read through the charts and can make informed choices in pre-processing steps

2. Interactively preprocess the data by taking the userâ€™s preferred choice of pre-processing techniques,

3. Make a baseline model summary, which can return ten various baseline models & predict the standout test data from selected baseline model.

4. Interactively select hyperparameters in a widget style tab, track the hyperparameters using MLFlow & predict on standout data.


Pywedge intends to help the user by quickly making charts, preprocessing the data and to rightly point out the best performing baseline model for the given dataset so that the user can spend quality time tuning such a model algorithm.

## Installation

```
pip install pywedge
```

For JupyterLab, please run the following commands in anaconda prompt to enable required JupyterLab extensions to display interactive chart widget,

```
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly@4.14.1

jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager plotlywidget@4.14.1
```

Mlflow is not a hard requirement in Pywedge, this is mainly to keep the pywedge light weight for the benefit of trying pywedge in web apps like Heroku. So mlflow has to be separately installed to track the hyperparameters,

```
pip install mlflow
```

Please note: Pywedge is available only in Jupyter Notebook & JupyterLab environments
